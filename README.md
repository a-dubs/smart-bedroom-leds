# Bedroom Smart Home Arduino Controller

Arduino that connects to my smart home via RF to control LEDs, speakers, and more

<br>

## Summary
 - Integrates perfectly with my [Smart Home Ecosystem](https://github.com/a-dubs/smart-home) via RF module using the MySensors protocol, allowing for easy control from my phone or any browser.
 - Manipulates 3 zones of LED strips, allowing for individual control of RGB color, brightness, and on/off per zone
 - Controls an 20 year old Sony soundbar & subwoofer combo by sending IR codes via an IR blaster, allowing for control of volume and input selection without need for a remote.
 - Detects motion in room and reports this information for use with presence detection and other automations.
